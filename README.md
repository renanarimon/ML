# ML
data science & AI

* clean data
* vizualization
* Classification models

In this project, the main methods I have used is:
1.	Scale: standardize the dataset by standard-scaler.
2.	PCA: dimensionality reduction.
my goal was to reach the best accuracy with lowest number of components, so I have tried to get the best balance between both.
3.	GridSearch: find best parameters in each model (using cross-validation).
4.	pipeline: scaling, pca, and fit model.
5.	Ensamble learning models: 
a.	Logistic regression
b.	KNN 
c.	Random forest
d.	XGBoost
e.	Gradient Boost
f.	Voting
g.	Stacking
Models I used but didn’t perform well, so isn’t in the notebooks:
h.	Ada Boost
i.	K-means
